about=Turtle tracks are an indicator of turtle nesting activity. Aerial capture allows for greater spatial coverage than in-person ground surveys at lower cost and risk. This module allows trained operators to capture turtle tracks from aerial imagery similar to ground surveys. The data produced is compatible with the WA Sea Turtle Database https://strandings.dpaw.wa.gov.au/
